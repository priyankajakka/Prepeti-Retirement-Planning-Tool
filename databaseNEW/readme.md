THIS IS THE NEW CODE

Changes:

1. There is a separate js file for the user (ret_user.js)
2. curr_age, ret_age, and life expectancy are entered by user during create_acct process
3. There is a change user setting kinda thing (changing password doesn't really work and i gave up)
4. The stocks + values are stored in SEPARATE js arrays (will make it easier when having to program graphs)
5. savings req over time and networth over time graphs r done

Things that are pending:
1. Assigning portfolios
2. fixing the change password in acct settings
3. Adding legend for the savings req over time
4. allowing user to fill out stock and other acct info in the create acct process
5. making graphs responsive
6. whenever the page reloads, it goes to the first page automatically, so we hav to fix that too

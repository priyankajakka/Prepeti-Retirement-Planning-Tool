THIS IS THE NEW CODE

Changes:

1. There is a separate js file for the user (ret_user.js)
2. curr_age, ret_age, and life expectancy are entered by user during create_acct process
3. There is a change user setting kinda thing (changing password doesn't really work and i gave up)
4. The stocks + values are stored in SEPARATE js arrays (will make it easier when having to program graphs)

Things that are pending:
1. Networth + savings graphs over time
2. Assigning portfolios
3. fixing the change password in acct settings
